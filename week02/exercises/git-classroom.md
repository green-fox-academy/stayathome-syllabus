# Clone your assignment

## Help

- [Questions to this exercise](http://askbot.greenfox.academy/questions/tags:github-quiz/)

## Introduction

There is an [Invitation link to GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/1aIPRJVL), which generates you a new repository.

- First you should authorize the organization
- And Accept the assignment

After these steps and a 'loading screen', you will able to see a page like that:

**Check the red cross**

**It means some tests are failed. Your exercise is to follow the steps below, and make it a green tick!**

## Step by step

### Clone the repository and open it

> You can clone the generated repository via GitHub Desktop. Now you don't want to create a new repository, you would like to use an existing one.

Find the `Clone Repository` option in the File menu or by clicking on the Current Repository and then Add, and clone what was generated inside the **green-fox-academy** organization.
You will find something like this, clone it:

![clone window](../assets/classroom/classroom-clone.png)

Open the project with Visual Studio Code

### Edit

Open the `README.md` file

- Add your first name and commit one with a meaningful commit message like: _Add first name_
- Do the same with your last name
- Do not use special characters, just the English alphabet

### Check it

- Push these commits to the origin
- Check: Is there a green tick or a red cross for your commit in your origin repository?
  - There should be a red cross, because you haven't asnwered the quiz yet.
  
If you see a yellow dot more than a minute just refresh the page.

### Edit more 

Let's **bold** the correct answers for the quiz questions!

```markdown
## Which is true?
- false
- false
- **true**
- false
```

In GitHub it will seem like that:

## Which is true?

- false
- false
- **true**
- false

### Check it again

- Push these commits to the origin
- Check: Is there a green tick or a red cross for your commit in your origin repository?
